Project Name- InVendor

Technologies Used- FLask, Sqlalchemy, HTML, CSS, Python

Challenges we ran into- We were trying to work on a collaborative environment named replit , which had planned to initially deploy our project on.
But on the last moment the platform refused to identify the libraries and we had to shift to local hosting , whch was quite challenging at the moment , but we deployed it in the end.

Learnings- We got to experience a part of what we call a webdevelopers life is. Thinking upon the ideas , Trying to build it , tacking through the errors , finding out the bugs and finally seeing the finished prodcut into a reality.
